- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry.
- what was finished.
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work).
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not
endangered.
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week).


Week 1

The team came together and established their identity. 
They appointed a Scrum Master and set up the Jira Site. 
They collaborated with fellow group members to choose a topic and engaged
in brainstorming sessions to determine the novel features of the project. 
Additionally, they explored and had conversations with the team about various 
software tools and libraries that could be utilized for the project.

Week 2

We have chosen topic one: Wait Management System. 
We organised the funcitonalities into epic stories, stories and sub-stories.
We represented this information in Jira.
We also researched the background. I compiled together the problems that are being
addressed by our project.
Next week we will conitnue with the diagrams required for the proposal.
Everything seems to be on track to be completed for the proposal due date.

Week 3
In our Wednesday tutorial, we completed the proposal. 
I helped complete the write-up and wireframing.
On Saturday, we gathered to set up the environments for the frontend, backend, data, and REST API layer.
During the meeting we managed to set up the Python virtual environment, as well as the React.js frontend layer.
Together, we deliberated on the optimal approach to incorporate a Postgres data layer into our project.

Week 4
Coding has commenced! We divided the team into two frontend developers and three backend developers. The seperation of work has not been strict. 
Currently, I am working on the backend for the project writing tests and setting up the database. Alongside Ravi and Tim, I created the necessary 
 framework for the class structure by designing individual class files for each class, establishing inheritance where necessary, and developing 
 tests. We haven't devised a specific plan for assigning backend tasks yet, so we're following a first-come-first-serve approach. 
I am mostly looking at the testing, debugging and database.

Week 5
The team has a more solid structure, with one frontend developer, two backend developers, and two data/testing developers.
 I am working as a data/testing developer alongside Ravi. My primary focus this week was to write testing and debug before the demo. 
 Wednesday was predominantly dedicated to fixing numerous bugs that had arisen. On that same day,
we conducted a successful demo where our code ran smoothly and performed well. 

The plan for next week is to chill out after a hectic sprint.

Week 6
Flexi week, just relaxed

Week 7
Completed the menu and user testing phase and have now initiated testing for orders, tables, and other components. 
Utilized SQLalchemy to implement the database for menu items and categories, with further implementation for the rest 
of the components planned in the near future.

Week 8
