- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry.
- what was finished.
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work).
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not
endangered.
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week).


Week 1

The team came together and established their identity. 
They appointed a Scrum Master and set up the Jira Site. 
They collaborated with fellow group members to choose a topic and engaged
in brainstorming sessions to determine the novel features of the project. 
Additionally, they explored and had conversations with the team about various 
software tools and libraries that could be utilized for the project.

Week 2

We have chosen topic one: Wait Management System. 
We organised the funcitonalities into epic stories, stories and sub-stories.
We represented this information in Jira.
We also researched the background. I compiled together the problems that are being
addressed by our project.
Next week we will conitnue with the diagrams required for the proposal.
Everything seems to be on track to be completed for the proposal due date.
