Week 1
Joined the tutorial, and created a group with Timothy, Ravi, Sami and Tejas. Appointed Sami as scrum master and decided on the name Romantic Cheese (randomly generated name). Joined the created Jira group. The finalized decision to work on project 1: Wait Management System. Decided to do meetings and chat via a discord server created by Tim. Decided to have weekly meetings on Sunday at 6 pm. The team goal for this Sunday's meeting is to read through the specifications, think of some ideas on functionality and getting it started and try to get more accustomed to Jira.  

Got a plan on filling out the proposal over the next couple of weeks. By next Wednesday, we’ll finish the background research and the week 2 weekend will be for the user stories/sprints and technical depth work. Set up a Google document to compile our notes for the proposal. Set a task to research current existing systems, their purpose, and drawbacks with a deadline of next Wednesday. 

Week 2
Discussed research performed on background research. On the Google doc, created a list of problems and their possible solutions. Also added information about existing systems, their advantages, and drawbacks. Further went on to discuss the 8 objectives including 2 novelty ones and sorted the dot points in the assessment specifications under the objectives we brainstormed. Asked Iwan some questions regarding the background proposal and defining our functionality. Had discussions on what was regarded as novelty and came up with good ideas on the group’s novelty functionalities. Decided to start writing up the background for sections we finished e.g., the problems and existing systems. Tim and Tejas would start writing it up and come up with some user stories for one of the objectives whilst the other three members would take up two of the objectives and think of some user stories for the next meeting. For myself, I would think of some user stories for Order Management and Menu Management. Then at the next meeting, we will flesh this out further, and discuss sprints and technicalities. Decided that the next meeting would be on Saturday at 6 pm. 

Met on Saturday and added user stories that each group member came up with over the last couple of days. The group document contains all the stories, with their respective subtasks and story points which we decided were developer days. Group members worked together to add epics and issues to the Jira backlog. Under each issue were also child issues that represented subtasks to be done. We decided on 3 sprints for the term and started to sort which user stories we would add to each sprint. Discussed the next parts of the proposal that looks at storyboards and system architecture. Decided to use draw.io to create the required diagrams. We had 4 diagrams to be made and split those up with two people working on the storyboards. I was allocated the software architecture diagram and also research the possible database software we could use for the project. 

Week 3

Group met up and checked in on the progress of all the diagrams. Most diagrams are completed and the rest should be expected to be done by the end of today. Spent the meeting fixing up and editing the proposal document, ensuring we hit all the dot points and covered all the requirements of the proposal. Asked Iwan questions about the specifics of the proposal to consolidate our understanding of the proposal and the project i.e. including novelty functionality in our diagrams and moving our user stories to all three sprints instead of leaving them all in the product backlog. Most of everything is complete, just some final edits and touchups before Friday's submission. Ending up finishing the proposal with editing and had Sami the scrum master submit it. The group will look to set up the environment and get basic things working during a Saturday meeting at 6 pm.
