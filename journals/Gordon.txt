Week 1
Joined tutorial, and created a group with Timothy, Ravi, Sami and Tejas. Appointed Sami as scrum master and decided on the name Romantic Cheese (randomly generated name). Joined the created Jira group. Finalized decision to work on project 1: Wait Management System. Decided to do meetings and chat via a discord server created by Tim. Decided to have weekly meetings on Sunday 6pm. The team goal for this Sunday meeting is to read through the specifications, think of some ideas on functionality and getting it started and try to get more accustomed to Jira.  

Got a plan on filling out the proposal over the next couple weeks. By next Wednesday, we’ll finish the background research and week 2 weekend will be for the user stories/sprints and technical depth work. Set up a google document to compile our notes for the proposal. Set a task to research current existing systems, their purpose, and drawbacks with a deadline for next Wednesday. 

Week 2
Discussed research performed on background research. On the google doc, created a list of problems and their possible solutions. Also added information about existing systems, their advantages, and drawbacks. Further went on to discuss the 8 objectives including 2 novelty ones and sorted the dot points in the assessment specifications under the objectives we brainstormed. Asked Iwan some questions regarding the background proposal and defining our functionality. Had discussions on what was regarded as novelty and came up with good ideas on the group’s novelty functionalities. Decided to start writing up the background for sections we finished e.g., the problems and existing systems. Tim and Tejas would start writing it up and come up with some user stories for one of the objectives each whilst the other three members would take up two of the objectives and think of some user stories for the next meeting. For myself, I would think of some user stories for Order Management and Menu Management. Then at the next meeting we will flesh this out further, discuss sprints and technicalities. Decided that the next meeting would be on Saturday at 6pm. 

Met on Saturday and added in user stories that each group member came up with over the last couple days. The group document contains all the stories, with their respective subtasks and story points which we decided was developer days. Group members worked together to add epics and issues to the Jira backlog. Under each issue were also child issues that represented subtasks to be done. We decided on 3 sprints for the term and started to sort which user stories we would add to each sprint. Discussed the next parts of the proposal that looks at storyboards and system architecture. Decided to use draw.io to create the required diagrams. We had 4 diagrams to be made and split those up with two people working on the storyboards. I was allocated the software architecture diagram and also research into the possible database software we could use for the project.
